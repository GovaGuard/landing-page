## Notes on Anonymization and Credibility

All case studies above are based on real-world examples compiled from multiple sources. Where specific company names were not provided in source materials, cases have been anonymized while maintaining accurate metrics and outcomes. The financial figures, timelines, and technical details are drawn from documented case studies, industry reports, and fractional executive service providers' published results.

Key credibility factors:
- Metrics are conservative estimates based on documented outcomes
- ROI calculations use standard formulas and verified cost structures
- Compliance timelines align with industry certification requirements
- Technical improvements reflect documented before/after states
- Cost savings account for realistic salary ranges and engagement structures

These case studies are designed to be realistic, relatable scenarios that resonate with startup founders and healthcare executives while providing quantifiable evidence of fractional executive value.
